# User-Specific-TODO-LIST-using-authentication-middlewares

The system is made using node where user specific todo lists have been prepared with the help of jwt tokens and cookies. A specific user can sign up ,log in after which the user is stored in a database with their passwords hashed. That specific user cqan customize their own todo lists as they can add to the list , edit , delete and view thier lists. For database connections MYSQL has been used with ORM(sequelize). Similarly, a bit of work has been done on trying to maintain the folder structures.
